# SystemsBrewology

This is the repository of a research project conducted at AlmaasLab, part of the SystBioLab at the Department of Biotechnology and Food Science at NTNU, Trondheim. The overall goals of the project, a collaboration between this academic institution and a small but growing selection of industry partners, is to expand our understanding of beer and its production through explorative but rigorous scientific approaches. It is our hope that a mix of state-of-the-art analysis methods, modeling, and machine learning will help make the craft of beer brewing not just a matter of know-how, but also a matter of know-why.
